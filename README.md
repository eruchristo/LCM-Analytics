# LCM-Analytics
An analytics framework to support life cycle management

LCM analytics is the practice of using data analytics to support life cycle management (LCM).  When the LCM practice is generalized, a set of standard analytical measures and approaches can be applied to make LCM more efficient and effective.  Business needs determine the LCM measures and metrics used.  For example, to solve the problem of long cycle times for a product, life cycle inventory analysis may be applied to identify delivery bottlenecks.

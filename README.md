# LCM-Analytics
An analytics framework to support life cycle management

	LCM analytics is the practice of using data analytics to support life cycle management (LCM).  When the LCM practice is generalized, a set of standard analytical measures and approaches can be applied to make LCM more efficient and effective.  Business needs determine the LCM measures and metrics used.  For example, to solve the problem of long cycle times for a product, life cycle inventory analysis may be applied to identify delivery bottlenecks.

###LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT
	A life cycle is the series of stages, or phases, through which something progresses, from start to end.  In a business setting, every life cycle consists of multiple aspects, including the business aspect (business case), the budget aspect (funding), and the technical aspect (product).  LCM is the strategy and practice of managing something through all phases of its life.  LCM can be used to effectively manage projects, products, systems, information, or other things.  Usual stakeholder needs include viewing current performance, understanding historical averages, and observing variances across business units.

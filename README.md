## LCM-Analytics
An analytics framework to support life cycle management

LCM analytics is the practice of using data analytics to support life cycle management (LCM).  When the LCM practice is generalized, a set of standard analytical measures and approaches can be applied to make LCM more efficient and effective.  Business needs determine the LCM measures and metrics used.  For example, to solve the problem of long cycle times for a product, life cycle inventory analysis may be applied to identify delivery bottlenecks.

#### LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT
A life cycle is the series of stages, or phases, through which something progresses, from start to end.  In a business setting, every life cycle consists of multiple aspects, including the business aspect (business case), the budget aspect (funding), and the technical aspect (product).  LCM is the strategy and practice of managing something through all phases of its life.  LCM can be used to effectively manage projects, products, systems, information, or other things.  Usual stakeholder needs include viewing current performance, understanding historical averages, and observing variances across business units.

#### LIFE CYCLE STAGES
An LCM object, such as a product, progresses through a set of stages during its life cycle.  Life cycle stages are not assumed to be linear, and each stage has its own attributes and needs.  Life cycle stages vary based on the LCM object, but six universal stages may be applied:
<br/>
- **Concept stage** -- The study period in which the concept and requirements are defined.
- **Development stage** -- The object is designed using the output of the Concept stage.
- **Production stage** -- The object is produced.
- **Utilization stage** -- The object is used in its intended environment.
- **Support stage** -- The object is maintained.
- **Retirement stage** -- The object reaches end of life.
<br/>

#### DECISION GATES
The life cycle stages are demarcated with turning points called decision gates, in which stakeholders decide how to continue.  The life cycle aspects (business, budget, and technical) are considered at every decision gate.  Verification and Validation may occur at multiple decision gates.  Just as there are universal life cycle stages, there are universal decision gates, including:
<br/>
- **New Initiative Approval**
- **Concept Approval**
- **Development Approval**
- **Production Approval**
- **Operational Approval**
- **Deactivation Approval**

#### LCM ANALYTICS BENEFITS
LCM analytics is a standard approach much like a software design pattern, resulting in consistent delivery, faster implementation, and re-use.  Also, the use of LCM analytics facilitates customer communication by establishing a shared vocabulary.  LCM benefits depend on the object being managed.  Exmaple benefits include decreased time to market (TTM), increased productivity, improved quality, decreased costs, and improved return on investment (ROI).
